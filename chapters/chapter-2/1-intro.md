# Mastering Directives in Vue.js

In this chapter, we will delve into directives in Vue.js, a key element
for mastering this front-end library. Directives allow us to add new
functionalities to HTML elements on the page.

We will explore several essential directives, such as `v-bind`, `v-if`, `v-else`, `v-show`, and `v-for`, providing detailed steps to understand how they function.

Next, we will focus on the `v-model` directive, which is particularly useful for two-way data binding in forms.

Finally, we will address the use of modifiers in Vue.js, which allow us to modify the behavior of directives.
